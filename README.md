## Explanations

### Task 1: Sum of List Elements
A program that adds up all numbers in a list. It creates a variable to hold the running total, then uses a for loop to go through each number in the list, adding each one to the sum.

### Task 2: Even or Odd Checker
A program that determines if a number entered by the user is even or odd. It uses the modulo operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder.

### Task 3: Factorial Using Loops
A program that calculates the factorial of a number using a for loop. The factorial is the product of a number and all positive integers below it (e.g., 5! = 5Ã—4Ã—3Ã—2Ã—1).

### Task 4: String Reversal
A program that reverses a string without using Python's built-in reverse methods. It builds a new string by adding each character to the front of the result.

### Task 5: Recursive Factorial
A program that calculates factorial using recursion instead of loops. The function calls itself with smaller values until it reaches the base case (0).

### Task 6: Sum of Digits
A program that adds up all individual digits in a number. It converts the number to a string to process each digit separately, then adds them together.
